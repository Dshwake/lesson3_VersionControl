            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An application server is a component-based product that resides in the middle-tier of a server centric architecture. It provides middleware services for security and state maintenance, along with data access and persistence. I find this term to be very interesting because it is the way the application stay under maintenance and it allows the proggammer to create web applications and a server environment to run them. This term is related to our course because it discusses applications and the servers that it is run on which is extremely important to furthering our education on the subject of web application development.

                <span class="text-muted">Database server</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The term database server may refer to both hardware and software used to run a database, according to the context. As software, a database server is the back-end portion of a database application, following the traditional client-server model. This back-end portion is sometimes called the instance. It may also refer to the physical computer used to host the database. When mentioned in this context, the database server is typically a dedicated higher-end computer that hosts the database. I find database servers interesting because they are kind of like the middle man between my computers and the other, they keep the computers connected. This term is related to our course because without database servers there would be no such thing as a web application.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A high-level programming language that is interpreted by another program at runtime rather than compiled by the computer's processor as other programming languages such as C andC++ are. Scripting languages, which can be embedded within HTML, commonly are used to add functionality to a Web page, such as different menu styles or graphic displays or to serve dynamic advertisements. These types of languages are client-side scripting languages, affecting the data that the end user sees in a browser window. Other scripting languages are server-side scripting languages that manipulate the data, usually in a database, on the server. I find this to be highly interesting because its basically like learning a whole nother language. This term is related to our course because we need scripted language to make web application.

                <span class="text-muted">Client Side Processing</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The client is the system on which the Web browser is running. JavaScript is the main client-side scripting language for the Web. Client-side scripts are interpreted by the browser.Client-side scripting is used to make Web pages change after they arrive at the browser. It is useful for making pages a bit more interesting and user-friendly. It can also provide useful gadgets such as calculators, clocks etc. but on the whole is used for appearance and interaction.Client-side scripts rely on the user's computer. If that computer is slow they may run slowly. They may not run at all if the browser does not understand the scripting language. As they have to run on the user's system the code which makes up the script is there in the HTML for the user to look at (and copy or change). I find this to be very interesting because with client side it is way more user friendly and they can do a lot more fascinating.This is related to our course because it has to do with designing the web applications.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Server-side  are run on the server so it require a server. This reduces the amount of bugs or compatibility issues since the code is run on one server using one language and hosting software. Server-side programming can also be encrypted when users send form variables, protecting users against any hack attempts. Some examples of server-side programming languages are C#,VB.NETShop, and PHP.Server-side scripting is different from client-side scripting where scripts are run on the web browser, usually in JavaScript. The primary advantage to server-side scripting is the ability to highly customize the response based on the user's requirements, access rights, or queries into data stores. I find this to interesting because this kind of works as a shield for viruses. Its relatable because if we didnâ€™t have server side then all of our web applications would be ruined
